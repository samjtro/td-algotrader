# td-ameritrade algorithmic trading

**this is a full ml implementation for algorithmic trading using data from tda**  
**for just the go tda API hook, see [go-tda](https://github.com/samjtro/go-tda)**  
**this project is migrating to go**

## what is this

using tda data to train N-BEATS for short-term & Prophet + RNN+LSTM for long-term & short-term reinforcement
- develop trading strategies & find new portfolio management strategies
- properly train short-term input and reinforce through a variety of model implementations, ultimately allowing for much more precise downtime management as well as short-term (day trading) implementations
